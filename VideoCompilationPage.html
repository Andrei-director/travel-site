            <h2>First dev job at 45</h2>
            <p>Eric Carlson is a self-taught software engineer at Cisco. In his early 20s, he worked his way up to
                manager at the busiest Dominos Pizza in Canada. He eventually went to college and studied liberal arts,
                then worked as a teacher for two decades before teaching himself programming using freeCodeCamp.

                He got his first developer job at age 45 by using his programming skills to pivot into a more technical
                role within a big telecom company. And he's since gone further down the stack, doing back end work and
                now DevOps.</p>
